# Tankbuddy

Tankbuddy Addon for vanilla WoW 1.12.1
Based on: https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tank-buddy

I have been using Tankbuddy for a while, and decided some time ago to make my own modification to the addon.

This version tells if the mob that resisted taunt had a raid icon.

Example:- My taunt has been resisted by CROSS Firesworn CROSS ! -
